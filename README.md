# Whack-A-Mole-Game-Project
Whack-a-Mole is a game built using the STM32F407VGT microcontroller and Keil MDK. LEDs light up randomly, and players press buttons to "whack" the moles. 
This project demonstrates real-time processing and hardware interfacing. 

## Description

"Whack A Mole" is an interactive game developed using Keil MDK for the STM32F4 microcontroller. This project utilizes the SSTM32F407VGT's GPIO and timer peripherals to create a fun and engaging Whack-a-Mole experience. The game features multiple LEDs representing moles that light up randomly, and players must press corresponding buttons to "whack" the moles as quickly as possible. This project demonstrates the integration of real-time processing and hardware interfacing in embedded systems design.
